## Why I Built This

The very first actual program I wrote was a lightcycle game on the Commodore VIC-20 back in 1982. There were no graphics routines, so we had to re-map keyboard characters to whatever sprites we needed. It was fun drawing a lightcycle in an 8×8 bitmap. The game grid was literally a grid of characters. I can’t remember the exact size, but a quick search says 22×23 characters. The game was extremely low-res, but it ran, and two people could play.

Today, we find ourselves in an incredible moment in technology history with the advancements in AI, so I wanted to recreate that original sense of wonder and do something more than just forms and data. I set out to build my very first program once again.

I’ve got to say, it came out way better than I expected, and it was completed in just a few hours. What a world we live in. It was a fun experiment and every bit as enjoyable as writing the first one. Mission accomplished.

## Development

The app was 100% coded by Open AI Codex with my prompts. The lightcycles were generated by SVGAI.org and slightly modified by me in Affinity. The sound effects were created by me in Apple Logic by mixing loops from the loops libraries.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

- The build uses a relative base path, so it works on GitHub Pages or any subdirectory host.
- Live app: https://dpellerin.github.io/tron-react/
- Run `npm run build` and publish the `dist/` folder.
