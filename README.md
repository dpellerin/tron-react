# Tron

A modern, AI code assisted browser remake of my very first VIC-20 light-cycle game. You play against the computer in a neon arena, leaving a solid trail and trying to force a crash.

## Game Summary

- Single-player vs computer opponent
- Smooth continuous movement with glowing trails
- Round-based scoring; first to N wins (user selectable)
- Computer opponent tries to cut you off and force collisions

## Controls (Planned)

- Player: WASD or arrow keys
- Start round: Space
- Reset match: R

## Visual Direction

- Primary-color neon glow on black or deep blue
- Classic arcade score display at top left/right

## Status

- Planning complete; implementation pending

## Notes

- MVP uses canvas rendering via React
- Optional future: local two-player, Xbox controller
